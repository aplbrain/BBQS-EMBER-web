        <p>
          We partner with certain third parties to collect user access and activity information to

          certain information for the purposes discussed above. You may learn more about Google

        <p class="text-bold">Data Security and Retention</p>

        <p>
          JHU/APL uses commercially reasonable physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to
          protect your information and data against loss or unauthorized access, use, modification,
          or deletion. However, no security program is 100% secure, and thus we cannot guarantee the
          absolute security of your information or data.
        </p>

        <p>
          JHU/APL retains your user access and activity information for as long as reasonably
          necessary for its legitimate purposes, to provide the Sites to you, to fulfill the
          purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law. If you would like us to
          delete data you have submitted or uploaded, please submit an email request as specified

        <p class="text-bold">Children's Privacy</p>

        <p>
          The Sites are not intended for nor directed to children under 13, and we will not
          knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13. We request that
          children under 13 do not provide information to us through the Sites.

          information to, or otherwise share your user access and activity information with,
          affiliates or third parties in the United States. The data-protection laws in these
          countries may be different from, and less stringent than, those in your country of
          residence. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy in the course of using the Sites or by
          providing any personal information to us, you expressly consent to such transfer and
          processing.
