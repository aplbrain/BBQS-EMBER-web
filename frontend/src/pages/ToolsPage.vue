            The EMBER team is committed to developing a resource that will serve a wide range of
            primary and secondary research needs. We are currently working closely with BBQS Data
            Coordination and Artificial Intelligence Center (DCAIC) as well as a number of members
            of the broader neurophysiology community to compile, optimize, or develop tools that can
            be readily deployed on the EMBER-hosted data. Please contact the EMBER team if you wish
            to get involved in these ongoing discussions.
