            These Terms, and any dispute between you and us, shall be governed by the laws of the
            State of Maryland, United States of America, without regard to principles of conflicts
            of law that would result in the application of the law of any other jurisdiction, except
            that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of the
            arbitration provisions set forth below. Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event
            that this Section 11 is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute,
            either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Arbitration Procedures or as a
            result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any claim or
            dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and us must be resolved exclusively by
            a state or federal court located in Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America,
            except that you or we are permitted (a) to bring small claims actions in state court in
            the county in which you reside if such court has a small claims procedure and if such
            court is located in the United States of America; (b) to bring claims for injunctive
            relief in any court having jurisdiction over the parties; or (c) to seek enforcement of
            a judgment in any court having jurisdiction over the parties. To the extent permitted by
            law, you and we agree to waive trial by jury in any court proceeding.

                our intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade
                secrets, copyrights and patents) or for items (a)–(c) set forth in Section 11
                (Governing Law; Dispute Resolutions), you agree that all disputes between you and us
                (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) arising out of or relating to
                these Terms, our Services, and/or our Privacy Policy shall be finally resolved by
                arbitration before a single arbitrator conducted in the English language in the
                State of Maryland, U.S.A. under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
                Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and you and we hereby expressly waive trial by jury.
                You and we shall appoint as sole arbitrator a person mutually agreed by you and us
                or, if you and we cannot agree within thirty (30) days of either party’s request for
                arbitration, such single arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA upon the request of
                either party. The parties shall bear equally the cost of the arbitration (except
                that the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys'
                fees incurred in connection with the arbitration in such an amount as may be
                determined by the arbitrator). All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and
                binding on both parties and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, application may be made to any court for a judicial
                acceptance of the award or order of enforcement. Under no circumstances shall the
                arbitrator be authorized to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with
                these Terms.

                Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that
                if we make any change to the Arbitration Procedures (other than a change to any

                apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against us prior to the
                effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate the Arbitration
                Procedures from these Terms, such termination shall not be effective until thirty
                (30) days after the version of these Terms not containing the Arbitration Procedures
                is posted to our Website, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed
